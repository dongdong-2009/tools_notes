How to extract (android )boot.img?


boot.img is a small(ish) file that contain two main parts.
          * kernel(important for android)
          * ramdisk( a core set of instruction & binaries)


Unpack boot.img:

It contains the following steps:

Download the tool using wget http://android-serialport-api.googlecode.com/files/android_bootimg_tools.tar.gz
Extract the file using tar xvzf android_bootimg_tools.tar.gz.

It contains two binaries:
       * unpackbootimg
       * mkbootimg
       
3.Then execute ./unpackbootimg -i <filename.img> -o <output_path>

It will contain,

           * boot.img-zImage     ----> kernel
           * boot.img-ramdisk.gz ----> ramdisk
We can extract ramdisk also, using the following command

gunzip -c boot.img-ramdisk.gz | cpio -i
After changing the files, we can again pack those files as boot.img using mkbootimg

Have fun!


I am getting error at third step please help me...the terminal says unpackbootimg command not found – Rahul Matte Jun 17 '14 at 10:04
  	 	
Getting the same error for step 3 on Mint 17 here. Tried running them by sudo and after chmod 755 to no avail. – Nisse Sep 11 '14 at 4:41
  	 	
In step 3, make sure output_path already exists, otherwise unpackbootimg will segfault. – Aldaviva Feb 13 '16 at 3:07

Just clone the code from github: github.com/osm0sis/mkbootimg – Albus Dumbledore Mar 15 at 5:37


boot.img is not a compressed filesystem image like system.img. 
It is read by the bootloader, and contains little more than a kernel image and a ramdisk image.

Some binary distribution ship the kernel and ramdisk images separately. 
In that case you don't need to do anything with boot.img, just regenerate a new one with mkbootimg.



If you need to extract information from a boot.img, try split_bootimg (by William Enck, via the Android wiki).
The link to split_bootimg is no longer valid. – Nathan Osman Sep 28 '13 at 3:19

I use opensuse. I have installed abootimg. If you want to extract (boot|recovery).img run such:

abootimg -x (boot|recovery).img
Then you get next files: bootimg.cgf, zImage and initrd.img

If you want to pack image you run such

abootimg --create (boot|recovery).img -f bootimg.cfg -k zImage -r initrd.img
Then you'll get (boot|recovery).img

Enjoy
